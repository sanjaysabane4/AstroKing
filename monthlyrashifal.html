            <div class="text-muted"><b>September 1997</b></div>
            <h2 id="General">General</h2>
            <p>The month of July can be expected to be better than average for Aquarius natives. The beginning of the
                month will be a bit slow in terms of functioning. Business can keep your mind upbeat. There will be
                laziness and confusion. Employed people need to be mindful of their work. The tendency to make excuses
                has to be left, otherwise you may get into troubles. <br>
                Conditions will begin to improve in the second half of the month. You will get involved in business and
                you will gradually become conscious of your work. Make business / business related decisions in the
                second half. Additional caution is needed. From the point of view of academics, this month will bring in
                mixed results. The Sun will remain in the fifth house in the first half of the month, due to being very
                full of energy, the mind can get distracted from studies. Your mind will run after new things. <br>
                The period is favourable for competitive exams. However, the latter half of the month will prove to be
                beneficial for students. Those who desire to study abroad need more efforts on their part now. From the
                point of view of family happiness, this month will have mixed results for you. Do not be indifferent to
                family responsibilities. However, in the second half of the month, your sense of responsibility will
                increase. There will be full cooperation of brothers and sisters. <br>
                The natives who have a love affair need to be a little restrained at the beginning of the month.
                Inculcate sweetness to your speech and do not try to dominate each other, it can cause distress.
                However, things will get better very soon. The bitterness of relationships will disappear. Communication
                with each other will be better. Proximity will increase. The month of July is going to be enjoyable for
                married natives. There will be a lot of sweetness in your relationship with your spouse. <br>
                The first half of the month is going to be better in terms of income from work. There will be a lot of
                income flowing into your hands. There will be special benefits from the cooperation of the
                administration. Sources of income will remain constant in the latter half, but expenditures may also
                increase. There may be a long distance journey etc. The month is going to be positive from the health
                point of view.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Career">Career</h2>
            <p>From the point of view of career and work, July is going to be full of ups and downs. The presence of
                Ketu in the tenth house is likely to disturb the work space. You will have a hard time concentrating at
                work. The mind will remain alert and new things will keep ushering into the mind. New ideas will not let
                you focus on anything. <br>
                Employed people may have to face the resentment of their superiors in the office. Sun's presence in the
                fifth house is also indicative of a change in job. Employed people need to put their mind and heart into
                work, otherwise senior officers may remain displeased with you. By moving into the sixth house of the
                Sun on the 16th, you can be successful in conquering the troubles of your workspace. <br>
                Time will improve gradually. It will be a good time from the business point of view. The first half of
                the month will be better in terms of business. You can succeed in making good deals in business. The
                latter is a time to take a little care. In the latter half, business decisions will need to be made very
                carefully and carefully. Keep note of all the transactions being made.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Finance">Finance</h2>
            <p>From the economic point of view, the month of July will be beneficial with some fluctuations. In the
                first half of the month, the Sun will be on the eleventh house. This situation is very beneficial for
                your income, which will increase. If your business is connected to the government sector, then there can
                be huge profit opportunities. With the help of governance and administration, new income opportunities
                can be opened. Time will be favorable for people with government jobs. <br>
                Your influence will increase. The first half of the month will be more favorable for earning profits in
                business. The latter half of the month can be a bit troublesome. Due to the transit of the Sun in the
                sixth house on the 16th, there will not be a favorable situation in terms of income, as it was in the
                first half. Nevertheless, you will not let your opponents dominate you. <br>
                There may be an increase in workload. One may go on a farfaraway journey in connection with business and
                it will be profitable. Mercury moving into the fifth house shows signs of good gains from business
                travel. Sources of income will remain stable, but expenses will also increase. Your energy will also be
                spent in dealing with opponents.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Health">Health</h2>
            <p>From the health point of view, the month of July is going to be normal. There is no possibility of any
                major problem occuring. The presence of Saturn in the twelfth house and the presence of Mars and Venus
                in the sixth house may cause some discomfort in the legs. <br>
                Insomnia, eye disorders and irregular blood pressure can trouble you. If you are already suffering from
                these diseases, then take your medicines on time. If you take care of food and exercise, then you can
                easily overcome them.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Love/Marriage/Personal Relations">Love/Marriage/Personal Relations</h2>
            <p>The month of July can be full of ups and downs for love affairs. Sun will be present in the fifth house
                in the first half of the month. This may lead to lack of cohesion in mutual relations. The tendency to
                dominate each other can cause tension in relationships. A communication gap or colloquial closure may
                also occur. <br>
                However, after the transit of Mercury in the fifth house from the 7th, the mutual tension will go away.
                The state of communication gap will end. There will be efforts made from both sides to understand each
                other, then the relationship will become smooth again. <br>
                Attitude towards each other will improve. On the 16th, Sun will change zodiac signs and they will move
                into the sixth house. This can lead to more intensification in love affairs. Mercury being alone in the
                fifth house will be good for love life. Mercury alone will strengthen mutual communication with your
                beloved. There will be a chance to get close to each other. You can get opportunities to hang out with
                your sweetheart. <br>
                The month of July is going to be very enjoyable for married natives. Jupiter is present in the seventh
                house, which is very good for your married life. The relationship with your spouse will increase in
                intensity and sweetness will prevail. There will be a feeling of trust and cooperation towards each
                other. For unmarried people, marriage is on the cards.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Family &amp; Friends">Family &amp; Friends</h2>
            <p>From the point of view of household and family happiness, the month of July can prove to give mixed
                results. The presence of Rahu and Mercury in the fourth house will result in mixed results in family
                life. Sometimes the situations will be very enjoyable, sometimes very dull. <br>
                There will be an opportunity to spend time with family. New plans will also be made, but people will not
                take your ideas seriously, and it may hurt you. The mind can get upset and feel depressed. Saturn
                sitting in the second house is giving it's third aspection to the house of family members, that is, the
                second house. This may cause estrangement or disagreement with family members about something. You can
                remain dissatisfied with certain things about your family members. <br>
                You can feel yourself being forced to make decisions. It is possible for your mother's health to
                decline. When Mercury changes its zodiac sign on 7th, it will be possible to improve the situation.
                There may be some concern or some problem with younger siblings. Once Mars enters the Leo zodiac on the
                20th, there will be harmony in the relationship once again. The prevalent communication gap will end,
                along with the differences. Your proximity will also increase.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Advice">Advice</h2>
            <p>It would be beneficial to recite the Surya Ashtak everyday. <br>
                Perform Chaya Daan, that is, pour a little mustard oil in the bowl and donate it.<br>
                Behave well with those who are blind, handicapped, servants and cleaning workers.<br>
                Refrain from maintaining a relationship with any woman other than your partner/spouse.<br>
